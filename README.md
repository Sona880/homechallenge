During this task, I utilized Cypress, which exclusively supports JavaScript. I employed the Mocha framework. I implemented the Page Object Model in my tests to avoid dealing with elements, data, and messages while writing them. To begin, you'll need to install Node.js, Git Bash, and Visual Studio Code. Create an empty folder, open it in VS Code, and then generate a package.json file by executing the following code in the Bash terminal: npm init. Respond to the prompted questions, including your name as the author and a description (ideally matching the folder name). Subsequently, install Cypress with the following command: npm install cypress --save-dev. You can access Cypress by running the command: npx cypress open. If you have my tests in Git, you can clone the repository into your VS Code. Before proceeding, ensure that you have installed all necessary tools, libraries, and frameworks.
